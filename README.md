# Claude Code Mastery

This file collects every advanced trick, workflow, and gotcha I’ve learned while living inside Claude Code.  
Commands, prompts, config hacks, automation patterns—if it saved me time, it’s here.

**WARNING** Things move fast; some snippets may break or drift out of date.

Feel free to copy, remix, and open issues when the inevitable bit-rot appears.  
Happy shipping!
